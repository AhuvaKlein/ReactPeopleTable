# ReactPeopleTable

Assignment:

Create a react application that has three textboxes and two buttons (Add and Clear). Beneath that, there should be a table. When the Add button is clicked, the texboxes should clear out, and the person should be added to the table. When the clear button is clicked, the table should be cleared. 

As an added bonus, see if you can add a delete button on each row, so that when that button is clicked, only THAT person gets deleted.

**(Additionally, I decided to play around and add an edit function :) )

Good luck!
